# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Our task is to find an optimal way of training the computer to recognize hand gestures from several three-dimensional coordinate points. There is a wide range of applications of hand gesture recognition, including virtual reality and games, robot control, and interactive sign language, etc. By evaluating and comparing several methods for the classification and recognition of hand gestures, we finally find a preferable way of dealing with unordered, large data sets with a great number of missing values.
